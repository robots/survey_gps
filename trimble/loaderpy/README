4000, 4400, 4700, (4800?) Trimble gps receiver loader
------------------------------------------------------

This tool can be used to load/flash memory of the Trimble Receiver. Most
of the original tools (loader.exe and winflash) are already outdated. They
can still be made to work, but require old hardware.

This tool is written in Python3. Only dependency is pyserial package. From 
hardware point of view you need serial port on your pc - usb to serial works.
I recommend some better eg: ftdi or prolific based. Ch430 based dont support
break on serial line.

Features:

4000/4400:
- firmware loading
- option reading
- option programming

4700:
- firmware dumping
- firmware loading
- option reading
- option programming


4800:
I "think" this receiver is similar to 4700, but I have not held it in my hands.
(donations are welcome)


Command line options:
First you need to select receiver type: --type xxx
where xxx = 4400 or 4000 or 4700
and port: --port xyz
where xyz is COMx on windows, /dev/ttyUSBxx on linux

Then you need to supply operation
--dump xx - this will dump firmware to file xx
--prog xx - this will program firmware from file xx
--opt_read - this command will read options programmed in receiver
--opt_prog xx - will program options specified in xx
--reset - if you want to reboot the receiver after done


Programming firmware:
Prog command understands multiple files:
-.X files - used for 4000 and 4400/7400 receivers.
-.bin files - binary file - not supported for 4000/4400/7400. 
      It will do something, but not what you expect as these receivers
      have firmware in multiple banks
-S19 motorola style hex files - used for 4700 firmware

Programming options:
opt_prog command wants list of options you want to enable/change/disable.
List is comma separated string of numbers, with NO space at all. If options wants 
different value than 0, you specify it by colon after the number.
Number of option is decimal, value of option is hexadecimal.

--opt_prog 0,1,2,4:0xff,5:5

This will set options 0 1 2 to value 0 (enable), option 4 to value 0xff (disable)
and option 5 to value 5. This is only example. You can read available options in
t4000.py file and t4700.py file.



Have fun and as always responsibility is yours.
